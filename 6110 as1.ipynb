    "Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a data analyst at an e-commerce company that sells a variety of products. Your company wants to better understand how various products perform across regions, in order to devise its sales strategy for next year.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided with data includes information about the product, the region where the product was sold, the price of the product, the number of units sold, and the date of the sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to clean the data as you see fit, and conduct exploratory analysis which will help the company build a sales strategy for the following year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the analysis, be sure to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) What conclusions can you draw about sales performance of various products and regions?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What recommendations do you have for the business?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Describe your data cleaning approach. How and why did you decide on which cleaning techniques to use?\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "When you're finished, submit a Jupyter Notebook which should include the answers to the provided questions. Your notebook should show all Python code used to complete the assignment."
